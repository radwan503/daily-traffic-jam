      <h4>NB:Which loop type should you use?</h6>
        <h6>If you're iterating through an array or some other object that supports it, and don't need access to the
          index
          position of each item, then for...of is the best choice. It's easier to read and there's less to go wrong.

          For other uses, for, while, and do...while loops are largely interchangeable. They can all be used to solve
          the
          same problems, and which one you use will largely depend on your personal preference — which one you find
          easiest to remember or most intuitive. We would recommend for, at least to begin with, as it is probably the
          easiest for remembering everything — the initializer, condition, and final-expression all have to go neatly
          into
          the parentheses, so it is easy to see where they are and check that you aren't missing them.</h6>
